<h2> Description</h2>
<p>Waffles are a beloved breakfast treat that is perfect for any occasion. 
    They are made by mixing flour, sugar, baking powder, and eggs together 
    to create a batter, which is then poured into a waffle iron and cooked 
    until it is golden brown and crispy. The best part about waffles is 
    that they can be customized to suit your personal preferences – you 
    can add fruit, chocolate chips, nuts, or other ingredients to the batter 
    to give them extra flavor and texture. Waffles are traditionally served 
    with butter and syrup, but you can also top them with fresh fruit, 
    whipped cream, or any other toppings that you like. Whether you prefer 
    your waffles sweet or savory, they are sure to be a hit with the whole 
    family. So why not give them a try and see for yourself just how delicious 
    they can be?
