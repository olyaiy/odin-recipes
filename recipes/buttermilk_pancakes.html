<h2> Description</h2>
<p>Buttermilk pancakes are a classic breakfast favorite that is loved by 
    people of all ages. They are light, fluffy, and have a slightly tangy 
    flavor that pairs well with a variety of toppings. To make buttermilk 
    pancakes, you will need flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, buttermilk, 
    eggs, and melted butter. Simply mix the dry ingredients together in a 
    bowl, then whisk in the wet ingredients until you have a smooth, 
    lump-free batter. Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat, 
    then spoon the batter onto the surface in small circles. Cook the 
    pancakes until bubbles form on the surface and the edges start to look 
    dry, then flip them over and cook until they are golden brown on both 
    sides. Serve the pancakes hot with your choice of toppings, such as 
    maple syrup, butter, fruit, or whipped cream. Whether you prefer yours 
    plain or loaded with goodies, these buttermilk pancakes are sure to 
    be a hit with the whole family.

    <ul>
        <li> 3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li> 3 teaspoons baking powder </li>
        <li> 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda </li>
        <li> ¾ teaspoon salt </li>
        <li> 3 cups buttermilk </li>
        <li> ½ cup milk</li>
        <li> 3 eggs</li>
        <li> ⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, 
            baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat together b
            uttermilk, milk, eggs and melted butter. Keep the two 
            mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</li>

        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high 
            heat. You can flick water across the surface and if it beads 
            up and sizzles, it's ready!</li>

        <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon 
            or fork to mix until it's just blended together. The batter 
            will be a little lumpy which is what you want.</li>

        <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using 
            approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles 
            appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula 
            and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
